(ii) A food delivery robot uses GPS + IMU + cameras to update its position while navigating streets. If it relies only on GPS, localization is inaccurate in tunnels.


Identify the approach improves navigation accuracy.


a) Dead reckoning only


b) Sensor fusion for localization


c) Ignoring localization and using fixed routes


d) Using a single camera feed

(iii) An indoor drone explores an office floor without GPS support. Instead of assuming a single fixed position, it maintains a probability distribution of its possible locations. With each movement, uncertainty increases,but sensor inputs like wall distances and camera readings refine its belief about where it is.


From the above scenario, Predict how a belief representation helps the drone improve localization. Give three specific benefits.
