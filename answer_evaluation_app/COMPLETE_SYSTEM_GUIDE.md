# 🎓 AI-Powered Answer Evaluation System - Complete Guide

## 📋 Overview

This system evaluates handwritten student answer papers using:
1. **DeepSeek OCR** - Extracts handwritten text from images/scanned PDFs
2. **FPDF2** - Converts extracted text to searchable text-based PDFs
3. **PyPDF2** - Extracts text from the converted PDFs
4. **Ollama LLM** - Performs concept-based evaluation (not just keyword matching)

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Three-Stage Processing for Student Papers

**Stage 1: OCR Extraction**
- Uses DeepSeek-OCR for handwritten text recognition
- Handles poor image quality and various handwriting styles
- Extracts text page by page

**Stage 2: Text PDF Creation**
- Converts extracted text to searchable PDF using FPDF2
- Maintains question structure
- Creates clean, formatted PDF

**Stage 3: Text Extraction**
- Uses PyPDF2 to extract text from the text-based PDF
- Ensures accurate text retrieval
- Parses student answers by question number

### 2. Concept-Based Evaluation with Ollama

Unlike simple keyword matching, Ollama LLM:
- ✅ Understands the **concept** in student's answer
- ✅ Accepts answers in **different words** if concept is correct
- ✅ Evaluates **partial credit** accurately
- ✅ Provides **constructive feedback**
- ✅ Handles **paraphrased answers**

### 3. Intelligent Question Parsing

Supports multiple question formats:
- Q1. What is...? (5 marks)
- 1) Define... [5 marks]
- (i) Explain... (5 marks)
- Question 1: Describe... (5 marks)

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

The Ollama LLM evaluates based on:
1. **Concept Understanding** - Does student understand the core concept?
2. **Key Points Coverage** - Are important points mentioned?
3. **Accuracy** - Is the information correct?
4. **Completeness** - Is the answer thorough?

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Change Ollama Model

Edit `app_ollama_complete.py`:
```python
ollama_evaluator = OllamaEvaluator(model_name="mistral:latest")  # or any other model
```

Available models:
- `llama3.1:latest` - Recommended (best balance)
- `llama3.2:latest` - Newer version
- `mistral:latest` - Faster, good quality
- `mixtral:latest` - Very powerful but slower
- `phi3:latest` - Lightweight, fast

### Adjust OCR Quality

For better OCR accuracy, edit `deepseek_ocr.py`:
```python
result = self.model.infer(
    base_size=1024,  # Increase for better quality (slower)
    image_size=640,
    crop_mode=True,  # Use tiling for complex documents
)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Ollama is not installed"
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
# Then run:
ollama pull llama3.1:latest
```

### Issue: "No text extracted from student paper"
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure the PDF has clear, readable handwriting
2. Check if the image resolution is sufficient (300 DPI recommended)
3. Try increasing OCR quality settings

### Issue: "CUDA/GPU not available"
**Impact:** OCR will run on CPU (slower but works)
**Solution (optional):** Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Issue: "Very little text extracted"
**Possible causes:**
- Handwriting is too messy
- Image quality is poor
- PDF is blank or corrupted

**Solutions:**
- Re-scan with better lighting
- Ensure contrast is good
- Use higher resolution (300+ DPI)

### Issue: "Evaluation is slow"
**Solutions:**
1. Use a lighter Ollama model (phi3, mistral)
2. Enable GPU for Ollama (it auto-detects)
3. Process fewer questions at once

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Best OCR Results:
1. ✅ Scan at 300 DPI or higher
2. ✅ Ensure good lighting (no shadows)

5. ✅ Clear, legible handwriting

### For Best Evaluation Results:
1. ✅ Provide detailed answer keys
2. ✅ Question paper should have clear mark allocation
3. ✅ Use consistent question numbering
4. ✅ Student answers should be organized by question number

### Question Paper Format:
