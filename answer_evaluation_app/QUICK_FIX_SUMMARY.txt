# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
Fixed the **TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType** error in DeepSeek-OCR.

## The Problem
DeepSeek-OCR was receiving `None` for the `output_path` parameter, causing it to crash when trying to create a directory.

## The Solution
Changed `output_path=None` to `output_path=temp_output_dir` using Python's `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`.

## Files Modified
- `C:\Users\nk\paperai\answer_evaluation_app\deepseek_ocr.py`

## How to Test

### Method 1: Run Test Script
```bash
cd C:\Users\nk\paperai\answer_evaluation_app
python test_deepseek_fix.py
```

### Method 2: Run Main App
```bash
cd C:\Users\nk\paperai\answer_evaluation_app
python app.py
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

### Method 3: Use Start Script
```bash
cd C:\Users\nk\paperai\answer_evaluation_app
start.bat
```

## Expected Outcome
âœ… No more TypeError errors
âœ… OCR processes all pages successfully
âœ… Questions are extracted from PDFs
âœ… Evaluation completes without errors

## If You Still Get "0 Questions Extracted"

This means the OCR is working, but questions aren't being found. Check:

1. **Question Format** - Should be like:
   - `Q1. What is photosynthesis? (5 marks)`
   - `1. Explain Newton's laws. (10 marks)`
   - `Question 1: Define democracy (5m)`

2. **PDF Quality** - Make sure:
   - Text is clear and readable
   - Good contrast
   - Not too small
   - Pages are not upside down

3. **Debug by checking console output** - Look for:
   - "Successfully extracted text from X pages"
   - Check what text was extracted

## Need More Help?

Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
python test_deepseek_fix.py
```

This will show you:
- If OCR is initializing correctly
- If it can read your PDFs
- What text is being extracted
- Why questions might not be detected
