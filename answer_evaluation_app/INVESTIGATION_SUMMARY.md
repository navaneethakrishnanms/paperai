# 🔍 Investigation Complete: "0 Questions / 0 Answers" Issue

## 📋 Summary

I've investigated your Answer Evaluation App and identified why you're seeing "0 questions" and "0 answers" after uploading PDFs.

## 🎯 Most Likely Causes

### 1. **Scanned/Image PDFs (80% probability)**
- Your PDFs are images or scans, not digital documents
- PyPDF2 cannot extract text from image-based PDFs
- **Solution:** Install Tesseract OCR or ensure DeepSeek-OCR is working

### 2. **Format Mismatch (15% probability)**  
- Your PDF format doesn't match the expected patterns
- Questions need format: `Q1. Question? (5 marks)`
- Answers need format: `Answer 1: Answer text...`
- **Solution:** Reformat PDFs or adjust extraction patterns

### 3. **Extraction Pattern Issue (5% probability)**
- The regex patterns don't match your specific format
- **Solution:** Customize patterns in `pdf_processor.py`

## 🛠️ Diagnostic Tools Created

I've created several tools to help diagnose and fix the issue:

| File | Purpose | How to Run |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `fix.bat` | **Quick diagnosis (START HERE!)** | Double-click or `fix.bat` |
| `auto_diagnose.py` | Complete automated diagnosis | `python auto_diagnose.py` |
| `view_pdf_content.py` | View actual PDF text | `python view_pdf_content.py` |
| `debug_db.py` | Check database contents | `python debug_db.py` |
| `test_extraction.py` | Test extraction patterns | `python test_extraction.py` |
| `FIX_0_QUESTIONS.md` | Complete fix guide | Read in editor |
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Detailed troubleshooting | Read in editor |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: Fix in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Run Diagnosis (30 seconds)
```bash
cd C:\Users\nk\paperai\answer_evaluation_app
fix.bat
```
or
```bash
python auto_diagnose.py
```

This will show you:
- ✅ Whether PDFs have extractable text
- ✅ What's stored in the database
- ✅ If extraction patterns are working
- ✅ Specific recommendations

### Step 2: Apply the Fix

**If PDFs are scanned/images:**
1. Install Tesseract OCR: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
2. Add to system PATH
3. Restart the app
4. Re-upload PDFs

**If format doesn't match:**
1. Check `FIX_0_QUESTIONS.md` for correct format examples
2. Reformat your PDFs to match
3. Or customize patterns in `pdf_processor.py`

**If patterns don't match:**
1. Run `python view_pdf_content.py` to see your PDF format
2. Share the output to get custom patterns
3. Or modify patterns in `pdf_processor.py`

### Step 3: Verify Fix
1. Re-upload your PDFs through the web interface
2. Check for: "Found N questions" and "Found N answers"
3. If still 0, run `fix.bat` again for updated diagnosis

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Current Setup:
- **Location:** `C:\Users\nk\paperai\answer_evaluation_app`
- **Uploads:** 2 PDFs found in `/uploads/`
- **Database:** ChromaDB exists but appears empty (showing 0 questions/answers)
- **OCR:** DeepSeek-OCR configured, Tesseract status unknown

### Extraction Patterns Used:

**Questions:** (in `pdf_processor.py` line ~87)
```python
r'Q[\s]*(\d+)[\.\):\s]+(.*?)\s*[\(\[](\d+)\s*marks?[\)\]]'
r'(\d+)[\.\):\s]+(.*?)\s*[\(\[](\d+)\s*marks?[\)\]]'
r'Question[\s]+(\d+)[\.\):\s]+(.*?)\s*[\(\[](\d+)\s*marks?[\)\]]'
```

**Answers:** (in `pdf_processor.py` line ~132)
```python
r'(?:Answer|Ans|A)[\s]*(\d+)[\.\):\s]+(.*?)(?=(?:Answer|Ans|A)[\s]*\d+|\Z)'
r'Q[\s]*(\d+)[\.\):\s]+(?:Answer|Ans|A)?[\s]*(.*?)(?=Q[\s]*\d+|\Z)'
r'(\d+)[\.\):\s]+(.*?)(?=\d+[\.\)]|\Z)'
```

## ✅ Expected Output After Fix

When working correctly, you'll see:

**On Upload:**
```
✅ Question paper uploaded and processed successfully
   Found 5 questions

✅ Answer key uploaded and processed successfully  
   Found 5 answers
```

**In Console:**
```
📄 Question paper appears to be scanned/handwritten, using OCR...
✅ Extracted 5 questions from question paper
Stored 5 questions in vector DB

📄 Answer key appears to be scanned/handwritten, using OCR...
✅ Extracted 5 answers from answer key
Stored 5 answers in vector DB
```

**In UI:**
```
Step 1: ✓ Question paper uploaded successfully! Found 5 questions.
Step 2: ✓ Answer key uploaded successfully! Found 5 answers.
Step 3: Ready to evaluate student papers
```

## 🆘 Next Steps

### Immediate Action:
1. **Run: `fix.bat`** (or `python auto_diagnose.py`)
2. **Read the output carefully**
3. **Follow the recommended solution**

### If Still Stuck:
1. Run `python view_pdf_content.py` 
2. Share the output (first 100-200 chars of each PDF)
3. I can provide custom extraction patterns

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes:

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| "NO TEXT FOUND" | Install Tesseract OCR |
| "Database empty" | Re-upload PDFs after OCR is set up |
| "0 questions extracted" | Check PDF format matches examples |
| "Pattern not matching" | Run `view_pdf_content.py` and share output |
