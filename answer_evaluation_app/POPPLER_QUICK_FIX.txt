ERROR YOU'RE SEEING:
--------------------
❌ PDFInfoNotInstalledError: Unable to get page count. 
   Is poppler installed and in PATH?

WHAT THIS MEANS:
----------------
Your app needs Poppler to convert PDF files to images for OCR processing.
Poppler is NOT installed or not accessible in your system PATH.

QUICK SOLUTION (Choose ONE method):
------------------------------------

📌 METHOD 1: AUTOMATED (EASIEST - RECOMMENDED)
   1. Run: fix_poppler.bat
   2. Choose option 1 (Automatic Installation)
   3. Wait for installation to complete
   4. CLOSE your terminal completely
   5. Open NEW terminal
   6. Run: check_poppler.bat  (to verify)
   7. Run: python app.py

📌 METHOD 2: WINGET (Windows 11/Updated Windows 10)
   1. Run: install_poppler_winget.bat
   2. Wait for installation
   3. CLOSE and reopen terminal
   4. Run: check_poppler.bat
   5. Run: python app.py

📌 METHOD 3: MANUAL DOWNLOAD
   1. Visit: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/
   2. Download latest Release-XX.XX.X-X.zip
   3. Extract to C:\poppler
   4. Add C:\poppler\Library\bin to system PATH:
      - Right-click 'This PC' → Properties
      - Advanced system settings → Environment Variables
      - Edit 'Path' under User variables
      - Add new entry: C:\poppler\Library\bin
   5. Click OK, OK, OK
   6. CLOSE and reopen terminal
   7. Run: check_poppler.bat
   8. Run: python app.py

VERIFICATION:
-------------
After installation, run this in terminal:
   pdfinfo -v

You should see Poppler version info (NOT an error).

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
⚠️ You MUST completely close and reopen your terminal after installation
⚠️ Simply closing and reopening is not enough - PATH changes need fresh shell
⚠️ On some systems, you may need to log out and log back in

STILL NOT WORKING?
------------------
1. Verify Poppler is installed:
   dir C:\poppler /s /b | findstr bin

2. Check your PATH contains the bin folder:
   echo %PATH%

3. Make sure you restarted terminal AFTER adding to PATH

4. Try running as administrator

5. Check detailed guide: POPPLER_FIX.md
