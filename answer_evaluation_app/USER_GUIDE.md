## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How long does evaluation take?**
A: Typically 1-5 minutes per paper, depending on:
- Number of pages (1 page ‚âà 5-10 seconds with GPU)
- GPU availability (CPU is much slower)
- Handwriting complexity

**Q: Can I evaluate multiple papers at once?**
A: Currently, papers are evaluated one at a time. Upload and evaluate each paper individually.

**Q: How accurate is the evaluation?**
A: Accuracy depends on:
- Answer key quality (more detailed = more accurate)
- Handwriting legibility (clear = better)
- Question-answer match
- Typical accuracy: 80-95% correlation with human grading

**Q: Can I use this for math or equations?**
A: DeepSeek-OCR can recognize mathematical symbols, but complex equations may have lower accuracy. Best for text-based answers.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Do I need GPU?**
A: GPU is highly recommended but not required:
- With GPU: 5-10 seconds per page
- Without GPU: 30-60 seconds per page

**Q: How much storage is needed?**
A: Approximately:
- Model: 6.7 GB (one-time download)
- Per evaluation: 5-50 MB
- Total recommended: 10+ GB free space

**Q: Can I run this offline?**
A: Yes! After initial model download, everything runs locally. No internet needed.

**Q: What if GPU memory is insufficient?**
A: Edit `deepseek_ocr.py`:
```python
base_size=640,  # Reduce from 1024
crop_mode=False  # Disable tiling
```

### Usage Questions

**Q: Can I edit the grading scale?**
A: Yes! Edit `config.py` to modify:
- Similarity thresholds
- Grade boundaries
- Marking percentages
- Feedback messages

**Q: What if questions aren't detected?**
A: Check that:
- Questions are numbered clearly
- Marks are in parentheses
- PDF is not corrupted
- Text is readable

**Q: What if student answers aren't detected?**
A: Ensure:
- Answers are numbered
- Handwriting is legible
- Good scan quality
- Proper lighting and contrast

**Q: Can I customize the evaluation algorithm?**
A: Yes! Modify weights in `config.py`:
```python
SIMILARITY_WEIGHTS = {
    'cosine': 0.35,
    'sequence': 0.25,
    'word_overlap': 0.25,
    'keyword': 0.15
}
```

### Error Handling

**Q: What if OCR fails?**
A: System automatically falls back to Tesseract OCR. If both fail:
- Check PDF quality
- Verify handwriting legibility
- Try re-scanning at higher DPI

**Q: What if evaluation seems incorrect?**
A: Check:
- Answer key completeness
- Question-answer numbering match
- Review detailed similarity scores
- Adjust grading scale if needed

**Q: Can I contest the marks?**
A: This is an AI-assisted tool. Final decisions should involve human review. Use results as guidance, not absolute truth.
