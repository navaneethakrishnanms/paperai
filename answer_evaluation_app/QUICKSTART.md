## Common Issues & Solutions

### GPU Not Found
```bash
# Check GPU
nvidia-smi

# Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Poppler Not Found
```bash
# Windows: Add to PATH
C:\Program Files\poppler\Library\bin

# Linux
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

### Port 5000 In Use
```python
# Edit app.py
app.run(port=5001)  # Change port
```

### Slow Processing
- Verify GPU is being used
- Reduce PDF resolution
- Close other GPU apps
- Check `nvidia-smi` for utilization

---
