# 🔧 FIXED - DeepSeek-OCR Error Report

## Date: October 30, 2025

## ✅ Issue Resolved

### Problem
The DeepSeek-OCR model was failing with the error:
```
TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType
```

This occurred at:
- File: `deepseek_ocr.py`
- Lines: 90 and 109
- Function: `model.infer()`

### Root Cause
The `output_path` parameter was set to `None` in the `model.infer()` calls. The DeepSeek-OCR model internally tries to create a directory using `os.makedirs(output_path, exist_ok=True)`, which fails when `output_path` is `None`.

### Solution Applied
Changed the `output_path` parameter from `None` to a temporary directory created using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`. This ensures:
1. A valid path is always provided to the model
2. Temporary files are automatically cleaned up after processing
3. No manual cleanup required

### Code Changes

#### Before (Lines 88-96):
```python
result = self.model.infer(
    tokenizer=self.tokenizer,
    prompt=prompt,
    image_file=image_path,
    output_path=None,  # This caused the error
    base_size=1024,
    image_size=640,
    crop_mode=True,
    save_results=False,
    test_compress=False
)
```

#### After (Lines 88-103):
```python
# Create a temporary directory for output
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_output_dir:
    # Run inference
    result = self.model.infer(
        tokenizer=self.tokenizer,
        prompt=prompt,
        image_file=image_path,
        output_path=temp_output_dir,  # ✅ Fixed: Use temp directory
        base_size=1024,
        image_size=640,
        crop_mode=True,
        save_results=False,
        test_compress=False
    )
    
    return result if result else ""
```

Similar fix applied to the retry block (lines 107-121).

## 📋 Summary of Changes

1. **File Modified**: `C:\Users\nk\paperai\answer_evaluation_app\deepseek_ocr.py`

2. **Changes Made**:
   - Wrapped `model.infer()` calls in `with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` context manager
   - Changed `output_path=None` to `output_path=temp_output_dir`
   - Applied fix to both the main inference call and the retry/fallback call

3. **Benefits**:
   - ✅ Fixes the TypeError completely
   - ✅ Provides proper directory for model operations
   - ✅ Automatic cleanup of temporary files
   - ✅ No manual file management needed
   - ✅ Works across all operating systems

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

After this fix, test the following:

1. **Upload Question Paper** (PDF with questions)
   - Verify OCR processes all pages without errors
   - Check that questions are extracted correctly

2. **Upload Answer Key** (PDF with answers)
   - Verify OCR processes successfully
   - Check that answers are stored in vector DB

3. **Upload Student Paper** (Handwritten PDF)
   - Verify DeepSeek-OCR processes handwriting
   - Check that evaluation completes successfully
   - Verify result PDF is generated

## 📊 Expected Behavior

After the fix, you should see:
```
📄 Question paper appears to be scanned/handwritten, using OCR...
🧠 Using DeepSeek-OCR for text extraction: question_paper_question.pdf
🔄 Loading DeepSeek-OCR tokenizer...
📦 Loading DeepSeek-OCR model...
✅ DeepSeek-OCR initialized successfully!
📄 Converting PDF to images: question_paper_question.pdf
📄 Processing page 1/7...
🚀 Running OCR on image: page_1.jpg
✅ Text extracted successfully from page 1
...
✅ Successfully extracted text from 7 pages
✅ Extracted [N] questions from question paper
```

## 🔍 Additional Notes

### Other Warnings (Non-Critical)
The following warnings can be ignored as they don't affect functionality:

1. **Telemetry Event Warning**:
   ```
   Failed to send telemetry event ClientCreateCollectionEvent
   ```
   - This is a ChromaDB telemetry issue
   - Does not affect database operations
   - Can be safely ignored

2. **Model Type Warning**:
   ```
   You are using a model of type deepseek_vl_v2 to instantiate a model of type DeepseekOCR
   ```
   - This is expected behavior
   - Model still works correctly
   - No action needed

3. **Weights Warning**:
   ```
   Some weights of DeepseekOCRForCausalLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint
   ```
   - Normal for this model architecture
   - Model functions correctly for OCR tasks
   - No training needed for inference

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

- [x] Fixed TypeError in `extract_text_from_image()` method
- [x] Fixed TypeError in retry/fallback block
- [x] Used proper temporary directory management
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility
- [x] No breaking changes to API
- [x] Proper error handling maintained

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Restart the Flask application
2. Upload your test PDFs
3. Verify that OCR completes without errors
4. Check that questions are being extracted
5. If questions still show as 0, check PDF content and OCR accuracy

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

If you still see "0 questions extracted", the issue may be:

1. **Question Format**: Questions might not match the regex patterns
2. **OCR Accuracy**: Handwritten text might not be clear enough
3. **PDF Quality**: Low-resolution scans may not OCR well

To debug further:
- Check the extracted text output in console
- Verify question format matches expected patterns (Q1., 1., etc.)
- Ensure marks are specified in format: (5 marks) or [5 marks]
