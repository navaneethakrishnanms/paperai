is unchanging. This makes it inefficient in dynamic settings with unexpected
obstacles, as it cannot replot its course in real time. To improve adaptability, a react
layer is often added. This creates a hybrid system where the deliberative layer
handles overall path planning, and the reactive layer uses sensors to avoid
immediate, unforeseen obstacles.
2. B.PID control.
3. Ensures accurate path following by tracking the robot's real-time position. Provides
dynamic obstacle avoidance, enabling safe re-routing when offset block the path.
Improves delivery efficiency and reliability by minimizing delays and energy turns."""
