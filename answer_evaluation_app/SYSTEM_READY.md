## 🧠 How LLM Evaluation Works

### Traditional (Bad) Way:
```python
# Exact match - student fails!
if student_answer == correct_answer:
    marks = 5
else:
    marks = 0
```

### Our Way (Concept-Based):
```python
# LLM understands meaning
Correct Answer: "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy"
Student Answer: "Plants use sunlight to make food"

LLM Analysis:
- ✅ Understands basic concept
- ✅ Correct input (sunlight) and output (food/energy)
- ❌ Missing technical terms
→ Marks: 3.5/5 (70%)
```

### Why This is Better:
- 🎯 Evaluates **understanding**, not memorization
- 📝 Accepts different phrasings
- ⚖️ Gives partial credit fairly
- 💬 Provides helpful feedback

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No text extracted from PDF"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure PDF has clear images
- Check image quality from phone camera
- Try adjusting lighting when taking photos

### Problem: "Ollama not found"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Install Ollama
# Visit: https://ollama.ai

# Pull model
ollama pull llama3.1:latest

# Test it
ollama list
```

### Problem: "No questions found"
**Solution**:
- Check question numbering: Q1, Q2, etc.
- Ensure marks are indicated: (5 marks)
- Try using clearer formatting

### Problem: "CUDA out of memory"
**Solution**:
```python
# In deepseek_ocr.py, change:
base_size=640  # Reduce from 1024
crop_mode=False  # Disable tiling
```

---

## 📈 Performance Tips

### For Speed:
1. Use smaller Ollama model: `ollama pull phi`
2. Lower OCR resolution: `base_size=640`
3. Process fewer questions at a time

### For Accuracy:
1. Use better Ollama model: `llama3.1:latest`
2. Higher OCR resolution: `base_size=1024`
3. Enable crop mode: `crop_mode=True`
4. Better quality camera photos

Q2. <Question text> (3 marks)
```

### Answer Key Format:
```
A1. <Complete answer>
A2. <Complete answer>
```

### Student Answer Format:
```
1. <Student's answer>
